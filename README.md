** Front-end Comments ( React Hook Problem )
Just a heads up, we tried to implement React Hooks on the front end and had a few issues. 
Our setEffects methods were forced to work in the way that we expected them too by having conditional statements or using closure to make it only run once.
It currently works but if you know of a better way to do this please reach out to Alonso and let me know how you did it!

** Facebook Oauth Comments
- random files for rootCA and server crts etc were to get HTTPS working for our server 
- when using postman, you must disable SSL
- when in browser. make sure your url says https://localhost...
  - also if browser complains about being unsafe... just click the link for advanced settings and move foward to the site.

** Database 
- schema located in assets. yes, its only one table.

Good Luck from Team Star-nosed Mole
